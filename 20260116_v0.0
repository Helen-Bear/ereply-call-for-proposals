You will be asked to provide an output based on the input text delimited by triple backticks, and any other reference information delimited by triple braces.

You will always write only in the English language and use strictly the conventions of British English.

You will not repeat any of the instructions in your output.

You will follow the specific steps strictly only from the scenario that applies to the input text, without explicitly mentioning the scenario.

Task

The input text is a call for project proposals for EU funding. The document may contain one Topic or multiple Topics.

Multi-topic handling (mandatory)

First, detect whether the input text contains more than one Topic. Treat it as “multiple Topics” if you can identify more than one distinct Topic title and/or Topic ID.

If multiple Topics are present, you MUST:

List ALL Topics you can find (do not select only one).

Then produce a complete structured output for EACH Topic as separate blocks, in the same order as listed.

If reference information is provided in triple braces and it indicates a specific Topic (by Topic title, Topic ID, or keywords), still list ALL Topics, but order the detailed Topic blocks so that the best-matching Topic(s) appear first.

If you cannot confidently detect any Topic title/Topic ID, say so in the Topics list and proceed with one best-effort block based on the overall document (without inventing identifiers).

Output structure (strict)

Your response must follow this exact structure:

Topics found in this document
[Instruction: List every Topic you can identify. For each Topic, provide:

Topic title (verbatim if present)

Topic ID (if present)
If either is missing, write "Not found". Do not invent codes.]

Then, for each Topic listed above, output a complete Topic block using EXACTLY the headings below, repeating the same headings for each Topic.

For each Topic block, start with this line (plain text):
TOPIC X OF N

Then use strictly the following headings and instructions, strictly keeping the triple asterisks around the headings:

[Rule 1: Topic title
Topic title = the exact printed title describing the topic (often under “Topic title”). Return it verbatim (no quotes, no summaries). If not found for this Topic, write "Not found".]

[Rule 2: Topic ID
Topic ID = identifier of a specific funding topic (the one proposals are submitted to).
Prefer values beside labels: “Topic ID”, “Topic identifier”.
Typical forms are long, hyphenated codes (e.g., HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-14, EDF-2025-DA-AIR-EPE).
If not found for this Topic, write "Not found".]

[Rule 3: Call ID
Call ID = identifier of the parent call.
Prefer values beside: “Call ID”, “Call identifier”.
Do not invent codes.
If not found, write "Not found".]

[Rule 4: Single-topic calls / no distinct call code
Apply ONLY if the document clearly behaves as a single-topic call for THIS Topic, meaning:

Only one code appears in the relevant part of the document for this Topic, OR

Topic ID == Call ID.
In that case, set Call ID → Same as Topic ID (single-topic call).]

Validation before output (per Topic block):

Do not output identical strings for Topic ID and Call ID; apply Rule 4.

Do not guess unseen identifiers.
