You will be asked to provide an output based on the input text delimited by triple backticks, and any other reference information delimited by triple braces.

You will always write only in the English language and use strictly the conventions of British English.

You will not repeat any of the instructions in your output.

You will follow the specific steps strictly only from the scenario that applies to the input text, without explicitly mentioning the scenario.

Task

The input text is a call for project proposals for EU funding.
The document may contain one Topic or multiple Topics.

Topic detection, matching, and fallback logic (mandatory)

Identify ALL Topics described in the input text.

For each Topic found:

Extract the Topic title (verbatim if present).

Extract the Topic ID (if present).

Provide a brief, neutral description (1–2 sentences), based strictly on the text.

If reference information is provided in triple braces, attempt to identify the best-matching Topic using:

Exact or near-exact Topic title match

Topic ID match

Clear keyword or thematic alignment

A Topic is considered a “sufficiently close match” ONLY if at least one of the following is true:

The Topic ID matches exactly

The Topic title matches or is clearly paraphrased

The core objectives and scope explicitly align with the reference information

If a sufficiently close match is found:

Produce the full structured output ONLY for that Topic.

If NO sufficiently close match is found:

Produce the full structured output for ALL Topics found.

Do not invent Topics, identifiers, matches, or counts.

Output structure (STRICT ORDER - DO NOT REORDER)
Opening statement (mandatory)

Instruction:
If more than one Topic is identified, the VERY FIRST line of the response MUST be a single sentence in the following form (replace the number as appropriate):

“X separate Topics were identified in the document to be replied to. All X Topics are listed with a short description at the end of this text.”

If only one Topic is identified, write instead:

“One Topic was identified in the document to be replied to.”

Do not add any other text before or after this opening sentence.

Best-matching Topic based on input documents

Instruction:

If a sufficiently close match exists, state:

Topic title

Topic ID

One-sentence explanation of why it was selected

If no sufficiently close match exists, write exactly:
“No sufficiently close Topic match found based on the input documents.”

Detailed output

Instruction:

If a sufficiently close match exists, provide the detailed output ONLY for the best-matching Topic.

If no sufficiently close match exists, provide the detailed output for EACH Topic found, clearly separated with:
TOPIC X OF N

For each detailed Topic output, use strictly the following headings and instructions.

Topic title

Topic title = the exact printed title describing the topic (often under “Topic title”).
Return it verbatim.
If not found, write "Not found".

Topic ID

Topic ID = identifier of a specific funding topic (the one proposals are submitted to).
Prefer values beside labels such as “Topic ID” or “Topic identifier”.
If not found, write "Not found".

Call ID

Call ID = identifier of the parent call.
Prefer values beside labels such as “Call ID” or “Call identifier”.
Do not invent codes.
If not found, write "Not found".

Single-topic calls / no distinct call code

If only one code appears or Topic ID == Call ID, set:
Call ID - Same as Topic ID (single-topic call).

Validation before output (per Topic):

Do not output identical strings for Topic ID and Call ID unless this rule applies.

Do not guess unseen identifiers.
