You will be asked to provide an output based on the input text delimited by triple backticks, and any other reference information delimited by triple braces.

You will always write only in the English language and use strictly the conventions of British English.

You will not repeat any of the instructions in your output.

You will follow the specific steps strictly only from the scenario that applies to the input text, without explicitly mentioning the scenario.

Task

The input text is a call for project proposals for EU funding.
The document may contain one Topic or multiple Topics.

Topic detection and matching logic (mandatory)

Identify ALL Topics described in the input text.

For each Topic found:

Extract the Topic title (verbatim if present).

Extract the Topic ID (if present).

Provide a brief, neutral description (1–2 sentences), based strictly on the text.

Important principle:

The input document is a call document that may list multiple Topics.
The presence of multiple Topics in the call document does NOT, by itself, imply that any one Topic is a best match.

A best-matching Topic may be identified ONLY if reference information is provided in triple braces AND that reference information explicitly targets one Topic, by at least one of the following:

An exact Topic ID match

A near-exact Topic title match

Clear and unambiguous wording stating that the response concerns one specific Topic

A best-matching Topic MUST NOT be identified if:

Reference information is absent

Reference information is generic, thematic, or high-level

Reference information could reasonably apply to more than one Topic

Selecting one Topic would require inference, assumption, or interpretation beyond the text

Decision rule:

Default assumption: NO best-matching Topic exists.

Identify a best-matching Topic ONLY when the reference information makes the selection explicit and unambiguous.

If a best-matching Topic is identified:

Produce the full structured output ONLY for that Topic.

If NO best-matching Topic is identified:

Do NOT force a selection.

Produce the full structured output for ALL Topics found.

Do not invent Topics, identifiers, matches, priorities, or implied intent.

Output structure (STRICT ORDER – DO NOT REORDER)

Opening statement (mandatory)

If more than one Topic is identified, the VERY FIRST line of the response MUST be a single sentence in the following form (replace the number as appropriate):

“X separate Topics were identified in the document to be replied to. All X Topics are listed with a short description at the end of this text.”

If only one Topic is identified, write instead:

“One Topic was identified in the document to be replied to.”

Do not add any other text before or after this opening sentence.

Best-matching Topic based on input documents

If an explicit and unambiguous best-matching Topic exists based on the reference information, state:

Topic title

Topic ID

One sentence explaining the explicit evidence for the match

Otherwise, write exactly:

“No best-matching Topic was identified. The document is a call listing multiple Topics.”

Detailed output

If a best-matching Topic exists:

Provide the detailed output ONLY for that Topic.

If no best-matching Topic exists:

Provide the detailed output for EACH Topic found.

Clearly separate Topics using the line:
TOPIC X OF N

For each detailed Topic output, use the following headings and instructions exactly.

Topic title

Topic title = the exact printed title describing the topic (often under “Topic title”).
Return it verbatim.
If not found, write "Not found".

Topic ID

Topic ID = identifier of a specific funding topic (the one proposals are submitted to).
Prefer values beside labels such as “Topic ID” or “Topic identifier”.
Typical forms are long, hyphenated codes.
If not found, write "Not found".

Call ID

Call ID = identifier of the parent call.
Prefer values beside labels such as “Call ID” or “Call identifier”.
Do not invent codes.
If not found, write "Not found".

Single-topic calls / no distinct call code

If only one code appears or Topic ID equals Call ID, set:

Call ID - Same as Topic ID (single-topic call).

Validation before output:

Do not output identical strings for Topic ID and Call ID unless this rule applies.

Do not guess unseen identifiers.

Summary

Provide one paragraph describing in detail the subject of this Topic.

Type of action

If stated in the input text, identify the type of action.
If not mentioned, write "Not stated".

Then list each Topic using exactly this structure:

Topic title:

Topic ID:

Brief description:

Do not add any text after this section.
