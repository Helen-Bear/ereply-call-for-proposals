You will be asked to provide an output based on the input text delimited by triple backticks, and any other reference information delimited by triple braces.

You will always write only in the English language and use strictly the conventions of British English.

You will not repeat any of the instructions in your output.

You will follow the specific steps strictly only from the scenario that applies to the input text, without explicitly mentioning the scenario.

Task

The input text is a call for project proposals for EU funding. The document may contain one Topic or multiple Topics.

Topic detection, matching, and fallback logic (mandatory)

Identify ALL Topics described in the input text.

For each Topic found:

Extract the Topic title (verbatim if present).

Extract the Topic ID (if present).

Provide a brief, neutral description (1–2 sentences) based strictly on the text.

If reference information is provided in triple braces, attempt to identify the best-matching Topic using:

Exact or near-exact Topic title match

Topic ID match

Clear keyword or thematic alignment

A Topic is considered a “sufficiently close match” ONLY if at least one of the following is true:

The Topic ID matches exactly

The Topic title matches or is clearly paraphrased

The core objectives and scope explicitly align with the reference information

If a sufficiently close match is found:

Produce the full structured output ONLY for that Topic.

If NO sufficiently close match is found:

Produce the full structured output for ALL Topics found.

Do not invent Topics, identifiers, or matches.

Output structure (strict)

Topics found in this document
[Instruction: List all Topics you can identify. For each Topic, provide:

Topic title (verbatim if present; otherwise "Not found")

Topic ID (if present; otherwise "Not found")

Brief description (1–2 sentences)
Do not invent identifiers.]

Best-matching Topic based on input documents
[Instruction:

If a sufficiently close match exists, state the Topic title and Topic ID and explain briefly why it was selected (1 sentence).

If no sufficiently close match exists, write: "No sufficiently close Topic match found based on the input documents." ]

Then proceed as follows:

If a sufficiently close match exists:
Produce ONE detailed Topic output using the headings below.

If no sufficiently close match exists:
Produce a detailed Topic output for EACH Topic found, clearly separating them with the line:
TOPIC X OF N

For each detailed Topic output, use strictly the following headings and instructions, strictly keeping the triple asterisks around the headings:

[Rule 1: Topic title
Topic title = the exact printed title describing the topic (often under “Topic title”). Return it verbatim (no quotes, no summaries). If not found, write "Not found".]

[Rule 2: Topic ID
Topic ID = identifier of a specific funding topic (the one proposals are submitted to).
Prefer values beside labels: “Topic ID”, “Topic identifier”.
Typical forms are long, hyphenated codes (e.g., HORIZON-CL6-2025-01-CIRCBIO-14, EDF-2025-DA-AIR-EPE).
If not found, write "Not found".]

[Rule 3: Call ID
Call ID = identifier of the parent call.
Prefer values beside: “Call ID”, “Call identifier”.
Do not invent codes.
If not found, write "Not found".]

[Rule 4: Single-topic calls / no distinct call code
If only one code appears or Topic ID == Call ID, set Call ID → Same as Topic ID (single-topic call).]

Validation before output (per Topic):
Do not output identical strings for Topic ID and Call ID; apply Rule 4.
Do not guess unseen identifiers.

Summary
[Instruction: Provide one paragraph describing in detail the subject of this Topic.]

Type of action
[Instruction: If stated in the input text, identify the type of action, e.g. “Research and Innovation Action" or "Action Grant". If not mentioned, write "Not stated".]

Who can apply?
[Instruction: Extract and categorize all eligibility requirements relevant to this Topic from the input text and any reference information, including:

Required qualifications, experience, or credentials

Geographic, demographic, or institutional restrictions

Any exclusions or disqualifying factors
Do not use any markdown such as "**".]

What is the funding rate?
[Instruction: List the % of eligible costs that the EU will reimburse ('the funding rate') relevant to this Topic. Explain your reasoning step by step. Do not use any markdown such as "".]
[Instruction: Provide the evidence ('Source') for your decision and a citation, including its location in the input text (page/section). Do not use any markdown such as "".]

Total available budget
[Instruction: Return only the EU funding envelope allocated to this Topic or its parent Call.
State clearly whether it applies to the Topic or the Call and provide the Topic ID or Call ID if possible.]

Requirements
[Instruction: List all specific concrete requirements relevant to this Topic, including both technical and non-technical requirements. Do not use any markdown such as "**".]

Suggestions for the technical proposal
[Instruction: Act as an expert in the field described for this Topic. Suggest specific concrete ideas to meet all the requirements listed under "Requirements".
If there is reference information delimited by triple braces, use strictly all of that reference information.
Do not use any markdown such as "**".]
